## Architecture

Kasal uses a modern, layered architecture designed for scalability and maintainability:

**Frontend (React)** â†’ **API (FastAPI)** â†’ **Services** â†’ **Repositories** â†’ **Database**

The CrewAI Engine integrates at the service layer for intelligent agent orchestration.

## Known Limitations

### Entity Memory with Specific Models
Entity extraction in memory backends has compatibility issues with:
- **Databricks Claude** (`databricks-claude-*`) - JSON schema validation errors
- **Databricks GPT-OSS** (`databricks-gpt-oss-*`) - Empty response errors

**Automatic Fallback**: The system automatically uses `databricks-llama-4-maverick` for entity extraction when these models are detected, while keeping the original model for all other agent tasks.
